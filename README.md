## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run PulsePoint on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   **[Any specific backend runtime/database dependencies]**: e.g., Python, Java JDK, MongoDB/PostgreSQL server running.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/tusharbisane7/PulsePoint.git](https://github.com/tusharbisane7/PulsePoint.git)
    cd PulsePoint
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    Navigate into the `backend` directory and install dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    # Install backend dependencies
    # Example for Node.js:
    npm install
    # Example for Python:
    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **[Add any specific backend configuration steps here]**
    * Example: Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory based on a `.env.example` (if you provide one).
        ```
        # .env content example
        PORT=5000
        DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
        JWT_SECRET="supersecretkey"
        ```
    * Example: Run database migrations.
        ```
        # Example for Django:
        # python manage.py migrate
        ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    Navigate into the `frontend` directory and install dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # Go back to root, then into frontend
    npm install
    ```
    * **Frontend Environment Variables (if any):** If your frontend needs environment variables (e.g., API base URL), create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory.
        ```
        # frontend/.env content example
        REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    # Example for Node.js:
    npm start
    # Example for Python:
    # python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The backend server should start, typically on `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured port).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    From the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # Go back to root, then into frontend
    npm start
    ```
    The React development server will start, usually opening your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

You should now have the PulsePoint application running locally!
